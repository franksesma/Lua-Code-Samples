# Lua-Code-Samples

Provided in this repository is a code sample taken from just one of games I developed (Code Sample #1). The code in this script manages some of the lot and property features in the game; such as purchasing, editing, loading, and interaction. It also shows how it works together with other modules and player data. 

Apart from this code sample, you can visit these group links to view my full portfolio of published games developed over the past 6 years on the Roblox platform:
